## 📌 Overview
This project celebrates **25 years of NASA’s Terra satellite** by creating animated visualizations from Terra’s five instruments.  
Our theme: **Seasonal Earth Changes (Vegetation + Snow/Ice + Energy Balance)**  
The animation highlights how Earth’s land, vegetation, and reflective surfaces (snow/ice) evolve from 2001–2024, and how they influence the planet’s energy balance.
